# Tor Explorer

> Explore the Tor network in under 10k

An entry for the [10k Apart](https://a-k-apart.com/) contest. Tor Explorer allows you to view information on the individual nodes that make up the Tor network. It is essentially a rewrite of the existing [Atlas](https://atlas.torproject.org/) web app with some additional features such as pagination, the ability to save nodes to your favourites, increased performance, better accessibility/mobile support and offline functionality.
